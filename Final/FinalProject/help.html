    <h1> Navigation Help</h1>
    <h2> Welcome </h2>
    <p> Thank you for visiting this website. In order to help users help better navigate the website, this page
      has been created to explain general rules and the content of the site. I hope you enjoy your time! </p>
    <h2> Navigation </h2>
    <p> On the left of the header you will see the home icon, this takes you immediately to the home page and
      automatically logs you off of the computer. If you are in the middle of creating a game, this information will
    not be saved. There is no home icon in the main game page to prevent games from going unsaved. </p>
    <p>On the home page there are two buttons; if you don't have an account you may create one at any time.
      You must have a username to proceed further into the site. Once logged in you will be taken to custom
    page allowing you to create a new game. If you have saved games in the system, they will also be displayed
  and you can choose to play one of those games. Once you click on a saved game it is deleted from the system so
  re-saving the same game will not create copies. Also, when giving your games a title, make sure they are unique.
  If you save a game with the same title as another saved game the oldest one will be overwritten.</p>
  <p>
  <h2> Game </h2>
  <p> Once you start a game you are taken to another page where there is an empty canvas, an alphabet list, the
    word to solve, and three buttons. The first button allows you to save the game in the state that it is currently
    in. Once you save the game you are redirected to the user page where you can create a new game or start a saved one.
    The second button is the hint that you typed into the new game form; this is used to help other players when they are
    stuck. The third button allows the players to give up, this immediately displays the correct answer and makes all of the
    buttons disappear. A new button pops up and that allows you to go back to the user page.</p>
  <p> The players have a total of 10 guesses before the game is over. If the player is correct or if the player
  loses, the three previously mentioned buttons disappear and the new game button shows up. Everytime a letter is
chosen from the list, the button is disabled so players know which letters to not consider when making a guess.</p>
